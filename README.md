# CAP-UDA
An easy-to-train UDA method for remote sensing images.

CAP-UDA consists of a mathematically interpretable image-to-image transferring algorithm, two class-aware alignment losses, and a modified MCD. 

CAP-UDA can get superior results using only one-stop training. 

Like our previous study (RDNet) which focuses on small targets in RSIs, the code will be published here when the paper is accepted.
