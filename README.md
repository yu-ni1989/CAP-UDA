# CAP-UDA

CAP-UDA is an effective UDA method for VHR RSIs. It models the category-level relationship in a mathematical way. 

In more detail, CAP-UDA consists of an image-to-image transferring algorithm, two class-aware alignment losses, and a modified MCD. 

Using only one-stop training process, CAP-UDA can obtain superior results than state-of-the-arts. 

Like our previous study (RDNet) which focuses on small targets in RSIs, the code of CAP-UDA will be published here when the paper is accepted.
